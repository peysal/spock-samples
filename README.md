spock-samples
=============

Learning groovy and spock at the same time. All in one project.

Groovy is a programming language which is dynamic and quite easy to learn for newcomers. But it would be good if we can 
have structured and easy to read code sample explaining the functionality of Groovy. Instead of writing Groovy script,
I decided to start this mini project using Spock as a way expressing Groovy functionality.

What you can expect from this mini project:<br>
*	Basic knowledge using groovy. 
*	Basic knowledge using Spock. 
*	Accidently learning BDD.



I prefer we adopt the style below as a standard in teaching Groovy to the newcomers:

1. Write in groovy script with assertion and commit. Please don't go more than 1 page ya
2. Refactor the code to suit Spock style and commit



Currently we have 2 package name:

1. name.peysal -> all the code should be commit here. 
2. org.mhshams -> have more advance example on Spock. Just for reference. Later will be remove 




Ok guys let us start code. Any suggestion are welcome
